                <p>There are several buildings that you can get to and around, a bamboo garden, a small pond with koi and a rock garden. Please get the brochure that has the highlights of the gardens and the story behind them.</p>

                <h3>Skyline to the Sea Trail</h3>
                <p>The trail is beautiful and well marked. And hiking under the canopy of the redwoods makes it a comfortable hike, even on hot days. Watch your step as there are often banana slugs on the trail. And the 3 waterfalls on the Berry Creek Falls spur trail are absolutely beautiful and not to be missed.</p>
